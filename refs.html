        <h3> Event </h3>
        <input type="text" @input="eventInput">
        <!-- as you know many times we want whole event which trigger when any event occur
        in js so for that we can use event property in handler function of any event   
        look at the code we use param event but we are not passing it from our template
        vue will always provide to us on every event that occur and ve can get all
        properties of event and element there-->

        <!-- <input type="text" @input="eventInput($event)"> -->
        <!-- many times it happen that we have to pass event and also some params to the
        function so that time we can use $event reserve keyword to pass event and other
        params value as well -->

        <h3> Refs </h3>
        <input type="text" ref="refInput">
        <button @click="getRef"> get Element </button>
        <!-- we will get new data when v-model chang, computed property change, event happen
        but some times we want to grab any specific element from dom any time when we need
        just like we do in normal js by getElementById and other methods for that vue provide
        vary cool way which is called refs-->
        <!-- we can use ref property in any html or dom element and we have to provide
        it some unique name now vue will remember that element and store in $refs property
        as object so we can get that element any time in our code just by this.$refs.propertyName 
        wnd we will get and set all the property available on that element just like normal js-->
